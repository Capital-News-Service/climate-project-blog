    		<strong class="intro">Extreme temperatures pose a serious, long-term health threat for people with chronic medical conditions like asthma, respiratory diseases, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental illness and multiple sclerosis. We all know that people die of heat stroke in the summer or of heart attacks after shoveling snow.  We know a lot less about the long-term effects on large populations of living in extreme heat and cold. Reporters at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland are working with National Public Radio and students at Wide Angle Youth Media in Baltimore on a project to look at how heat and cold in Baltimore homes affect residents' health – particularly as climate change becomes more and more significant. <a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/spring-2019/baltimore-climate-temperature-health/index.html#contactus">Learn more and get involved.</a></strong>

      In the winter, it gets very cold in some of the classrooms at Mergenthaler Vocational Technical High School (Mervo), where I’m a sophomore. In November, Ms. (Swetha) Mohan, a geometry teacher, wrote this on the board to prevent students from badgering her about the cold temperature in her classroom.

      <br><br>Frigid temperatures in classrooms are a big problem across Baltimore, which has some of the oldest and most rundown school buildings in the state, according to the Baltimore Sun. I decided to interview students and teachers at my school to learn how cold temperatures affect their ability to learn and teach.

      On Tuesday, March 5, Capital News Service reporters talked with Allison Gost Breitenother, program manager for the Environmental Health Bureau of the Maryland Department of Health.
      Much of what was discussed focused on the dangers of extreme heat and severe precipitation, and health concerns stemming from climate change, including asthma and heart attacks.

        Carolyn Owens woke to find she couldn’t straighten her right arm. Her arthritic elbows and knees hurt in the cold. It was bad during the polar vortex in late January.
        <br><br>“It didn’t feel like the heat was on,” she said. But the furnace had been on--it strained in the cold to heat her wide, three-story rowhouse in Baltimore’s Oliver neighborhood. She sat near the vent and wrapped heavy towels around her legs, hoping to keep them from getting too stiff. She wore sweats, two shirts, a jacket and long socks.

              <p>Throughout the development and reporting process, CNS hopes to engage and connect with audiences and communities that are already interested in this topic. This helps us to better understand the nuances of the topic in addition to building an audience around the project. We hope the ongoing social media engagement leads to greater community involvement and interactivity, where community members will feel motivated to share the project with their online networks.

        <p>Over the next six months, journalists at Capital News Service will be working on a project that investigates how climate change is affecting residents of low income housing in Baltimore.
        <p>In addition to examining publicly available data and field reporting with residents, the CNS team   will place temperature monitors in the homes of Baltimore residents. These monitors will quantify the potentially harsh temperatures that residents endure during the hottest and coldest times of the summer and winter.  In total, the team has built 40 temperature monitors and will place three sensors in the homes of Baltimore residents who agree to participate.  We hope to work with residents in the future to build more.

            <p><strong>February 11, 2019</strong></p>
           			 For many people, the recent polar vortex was simply an inconvenience.  But others were at risk. In Baltimore’s rowhouses and poorly maintained old homes, extreme cold or heat over time can sicken or kill the very young, the fragile elderly and people of any age with chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart or lung problems. And as climate change alters temperature patterns, public health officials predict a growing problem.

           			 We are trying to understand how climate change-driven temperature extremes -- hotter summers, more severe winter cold snaps -- affect the health of people in Baltimore. Every year, people die as a direct result of excessive exposure to heat and cold. Those deaths often make headlines, but they represent only a small fraction of the people whose long-term health and well-being are affected by extreme temperatures. We want to tell the rest of the story and bring attention to solutions to problems...
