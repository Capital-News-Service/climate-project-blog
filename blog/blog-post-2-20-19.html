            <b>Capital News Service<br>February 20, 2019</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Over the next six months, journalists at Capital News Service will be working on a project that investigates how climate change is affecting residents of low income housing in Baltimore.

            <p>In addition to examining publicly available data and field reporting with residents, the CNS team   will place temperature monitors in the homes of Baltimore residents. These monitors will quantify the potentially harsh temperatures that residents endure during the hottest and coldest times of the summer and winter.  In total, the team has built 40 temperature monitors and will place three sensors in the homes of Baltimore residents who agree to participate.  We hope to work with residents in the future to build more.

            <p>The CNS team’s usage of sensors is modelled after WNYC and AdaptNY’s 2016 Harlem Heat project that found while temperatures oscillated outside on the hottest days of the summer, indoor temperatures remained unbearably hot.  John Keefe, formerly of WYNC and now the head of product at Quartz provided open-source code for the construction and usage of the sensors, which allowed CNS to use the same technology for the Baltimore project.

            <p>In order to construct the devices, CNS journalists soldered together the structural components of each sensor while members of Wide Angle Youth Media -- a Baltimore-based youth program that provides media education and resources -- assisted with the installation of batteries, SD cards and temperature cases.


            <p>Each device includes a monitor, which is made up of a small computer, temperature sensor, clock, batteries and SD card, which allows the device to record, track and store information. The sensors are designed to activate every 10 seconds and record temperature, humidity, date and time before becoming idle again.

              </figure>


            <p>CNS journalists will place each sensor in an unobtrusive, well-ventilated location that does not receive any direct sunlight. Instead of being fastened to a surface, each device will be placed on a surface that is unlikely to be disturbed during the six-month data gathering period..

            <p>As a precaution, every device is housed in a 3D-printed case built to prevent damage while the sensors are in use.

              <p>Each device includes a monitor, which is made up of a small computer, temperature sensor, clock, batteries and SD card, which allows the device to record, track and store information. The sensors are designed to activate every 10 seconds and record temperature, humidity, date and time before becoming idle again.

                </figure>

            <p>After the installation process, journalists will travel to Baltimore every two weeks and record data from each sensor’s SD card onto a password protected database. These visits will also present an opportunity for CNS journalists to examine the data with residents as a way to contextualize the data during potentially extreme weather periods.

            <p>CNS is currently working with members of the community and hopes to install the sensors this month. Data analysis will be ongoing for at least six months.
